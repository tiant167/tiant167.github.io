Hi， I'm Haotian Chai, a dog-lover, 🌈 friendly, living in Shanghai and Hangzhou.

The dog in our family is called Beta, and you can find cute pictures [here](/beta/)!

At this moment, I work at [AntGroup](https://www.antgroup.com/en) as full-stack engineer, former [Jike](https://okjike.com/), [Keep](https://www.keepkeep.com/) and [WandouLabs](https://www.wandoujia.com/).

In this blog, I will record some fragments of life, some thoughts after reading, and self reflations during work. Be curious about life and resist midlife crisis!

Hi, 我的名字叫柴昊天，宠物爱好者，🌈友好，目前居住在上海和杭州。

家里的小狗名字叫 Beta，你可以在[这里](/beta/)看到可爱的照片！

此刻我就职于[蚂蚁集团](https://www.antgroup.com/en)，是一个全栈工程师，曾在[即刻](https://okjike.com/)、[Keep](https://www.keepkeep.com/)与[豌豆荚](https://www.wandoujia.com/)工作。

在这个博客里会记录一些生活的片段、读书的感想、工作的反思等等。希望对生活始终充满好奇心，抵抗中年危机！
